## Usage / Installation

1. Download the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/urwrstkn8mare/galaxy-riot-integration/releases).
2. Make sure to delete any other versions of this integration first and quit GOG Galaxy.
3. Unzip the file from [releases](https://github.com/urwrstkn8mare/gog-riot-integration/releases) and place the folder in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed`.
4. Go to GOG Galaxy, open settings, and then go to the integrations tab. You should see `Riot` in the list of integrations and just click `connect`.

## Issues

When/if filing an issue please make sure to do the following:

1. Check [Known Issues](#known-issues).
2. Attach the log file for the integration. Can be found in `%programdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\logs` and will have `riot` in its name.
3. Try earlier versions of the integration. It's really helpful to know if the issue was caused by a change I made in a newer version.

## FAQ

- _Game time doesn't show the time before I added the integration._
  That's because Riot doesn't record gametime. The integration will only display gametime while you've launched it via GOG Galaxy 2.0 just like if you had added it manually. (This may change, see this [todo](https://github.com/urwrstkn8mare/galaxy-riot-integration/issues/7).)

## Todo

## Contributing

Thanks in advance if you want to contribute! Feel free to complete any [todos](#todo) for me or add anything else you want to add. Then just submit a [pull request](https://github.com/urwrstkn8mare/galaxy-riot-integration/pulls)! If you don't understand something about the integration (eg. a part of the code - it may be hard to read sometimes) then please feel free to ask me. You can do that via an [issue](https://github.com/urwrstkn8mare/galaxy-riot-integration/issues/new), Discord ([GOG Caf√©](https://discord.gg/bT2HJ9k)), or email (shaikhsamit@live.com). I also use some python scripts to build and test the integration so if you want, you can use it as well (see [top of build.py](tasks.py#L1-L10) for more information about how to use it and more).
