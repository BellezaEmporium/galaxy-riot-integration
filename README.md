## Usage / Installation

1. Download the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/BellezaEmporium/galaxy-riot-integration/releases).
2. Make sure to delete any other versions of this integration first and quit GOG Galaxy ['Settings' -> 'Exit'].
3. Unzip the file from [releases](https://github.com/BellezaEmporium/gog-riot-integration/releases) and place the folder in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed`.
4. Go to GOG Galaxy, open settings, and then go to the integrations tab. You should see `Riot` in the list of integrations and just click `connect`.

See [known issues](https://github.com/BellezaEmporium/galaxy-riot-integration/issues?q=label%3A%22known+issue%22+) in [issues](https://github.com/BellezaEmporium/galaxy-riot-integration/issues).

## Issues

When/if filing an issue please make sure to do the following:

1. Check [Known Issues](#known-issues).
2. Attach the log file for the integration. Can be found in `%programdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\logs` and will have `riot` in its name.
3. Try earlier versions of the integration. It's really helpful to know if the issue was caused by a change I made in a newer version.

## FAQ

- _Game time doesn't show the time before I added the integration._
  That's because Riot doesn't record gametime. The integration will only display gametime while you've launched it via GOG Galaxy 2.0 just like if you had added it manually.

## Todo

- Get previous game time tracking to work (Needs validation from the Tracker.gg team into production, as the API key is invalid for now)

## Contributing

Thanks in advance if you want to contribute! Feel free to complete any [todos](#todo) for me or add anything else you want to add. Then just submit a [pull request](https://github.com/BellezaEmporium/galaxy-riot-integration/pulls)! If you don't understand something about the integration (eg. a part of the code - it may be hard to read sometimes) then please feel free to ask me. You can do that via an [issue](https://github.com/BellezaEmporium/galaxy-riot-integration/issues/new), Discord ([GOG Caf√©](https://discord.gg/bT2HJ9k)), or email (shaikhsamit@live.com). I also use some python scripts to build and test the integration so if you want, you can use it as well (see [top of tasks.py](tasks.py#L1-L10) for more information about how to use it and more).
