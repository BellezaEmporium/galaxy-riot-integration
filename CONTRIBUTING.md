# See [Contributing](README.md#contributing) in [README.md](README.md).

## The below is from the [README](README.md) and I'll try to keep it in sync.

Thanks in advance if you want to contribute! Feel free to complete any [todos](#todo) for me or add anything else you want to add. Then just submit a [pull request](https://github.com/urwrstkn8mare/galaxy-riot-integration/pulls)! If you don't understand something about the integration (eg. a part of the code - it may be hard to read sometimes) then please feel free to ask me. You can do that via an issue, Discord ([GOG Caf√©](https://discord.gg/bT2HJ9k)), or email (shaikhsamit@live.com). I also use some python scripts to build and test the integration so if you want, you can use it as well (see top of [build.py](build.py) for more information about how to use it and more).
